# RampUP

A simple app to understand ARKit Framework released by apple.

# How does the app work ?

The app uses SceneKit and ARKit (It can also use SpriteKit) to analyze the real world and displays the 3D model in real time in ARSCNView. In addition to this the app also makes use of ARKit's functions to rotate/move the 3D model.

The app also has a popover View which gives a list of available 3D models which can be placed.
